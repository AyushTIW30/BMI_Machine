#BMI Calculator
This is a simple Python program that calculates your Body Mass Index (BMI) based on your height and weight. BMI is a useful tool for identifying whether you are in a healthy weight range, underweight, overweight, or obese. The program prompts you to input your height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms) and provides a clear output along with a category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese).

Features:
User-friendly interface with clear input prompts.
Handles invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values).
Provides BMI with a detailed interpretation (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight, obese).
Handles edge cases like zero or negative values for height and weight.
Installation
To use the BMI Calculator, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/AyushTIW30/BMI_Machine/blob/main/BMI_Machine%20Code
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
cd bmi-calculator
Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x is recommended). You can check if Python is installed by running:

bash
python --version
Run the program:

In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder containing bmi_calculator.py, and run:

bash
python bmi_calculator.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to input your height and weight.

Usage
When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter your height and weight. It will then calculate your BMI and display it, along with a category based on the value:

BMI < 18.5: Underweight
18.5 <= BMI < 24.9: Normal weight
25 <= BMI < 29.9: Overweight
BMI >= 30: Obese
Example:

css
Welcome to the BMI Calculator!
Enter your height in meters (e.g., 1.75): 1.75
Enter your weight in kilograms (e.g., 70): 70

Your BMI is: 22.86
You have a normal weight.
Code Explanation
Inputs: The user is asked to input their height in meters and weight in kilograms.
BMI Calculation: The program calculates the BMI using the formula:
BMI
=
weight (kg)
height (m)
2
BMI= 
height (m) 
2
 
weight (kg)
​
 
Output: The BMI value is printed with two decimal places, and a message is displayed based on the BMI range.
Error Handling: If the input is not a valid number or the values for height and weight are zero or negative, the program will prompt the user to enter valid values.
